## What this is
Two summers ago, I rediscovered my love for reading on a vacation and dove headfirst into buying 5 books at a time and finishing them. I kept track of the books I read in 2021 and set a goal to read 25 books in 2022. I wanted to finalize and publish what I accomplished, what I learned and build something to record it.

## What this isn't
That being said, my memory is fuzzy going back a year ago. I only remember pieces and moments, so this isn't a record of the best points of each book or even fully what I "learned". It's a record, a unfair star rating and a comment about each book

## Dunbar's number
One concept that followed me throughout a multiple books was [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number). You can intimately know 1 person, have 5 close friends, 15 best friends, 50 good friends and ending with 150 friends. Outside of that, 500 acquaintances, 1500 known names, and 5000 known faces. This idea really stuck with me as I've been trying to understand what it means to have friends in my 30's AND figure out how to lead a team that crossed 150 people. (Deep Work, At Your Best, Team Topologies, You Are Not Your Own, The Life You're Looking For, and possibly some others)

## Genre
Another theme you'll see here is a large dichotomy of design/work books and Christian faith books. This represents a bit chunk of my life and thinking. As I've been lining up books to read for 2023, I see this playing out again, except with more fiction.

And with that preamble, here are the 29 books I read this year (honestly, if I knew I was going to get to 29, I would have pushed a little harder for 30 books)!

## Books I Read in 2022

1.  ***At Your Best*, Carey Nieuwhof** 
   
    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - "Nobody will ever ask you to accomplish your top priorities. They will only ask you to accomplish theirs" This book really set up my year to make sure I was available to do my best work, with the right people, at the right times. 

2.  ***The God of the Garden*, Andrew Peterson** 
    
    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - I remember being inspired by this book it was beautifully written. But even looking at my notes, I still don't really remember what it was about. I definitely felt inspired to invest in a Home for our family.

3.  ***Team Topologies*, Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais** 
   
    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - This was helpful way to thinking about growing and maintaining larger technology teams and controlling how they work together. Probably could have learned as much from a blog post, but still helpful. 

4.  ***Where the Light Fell*, Philip Yancey** 
   
    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - This was disturbing, depressing, and beautiful at the same time (like a good memoir should be!) Yancey was born in the late 40's to a childhood full of polio, failed faith healings, fundamentalism, anti-integration, racism, KKK, poverty, loss, fear, political upheaval, emotional and spiritual abuse, and much more.

05.	***Out of Office*, Anne Helen Petersen and Charlie Warzel** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - I was really hoping for a book that would help me understand how to run a remote team better in a post-COVID world. This felt very journalistic and I don't remember much of it other than not getting much out of it.

06.	***You‚Äôre Not Listening*, Kate Murphy** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - This was our first work Book Club read. It was an excellent reminder to listen, be curious and ask more questions. As much as I feel it's my purpose to lead and drive conversation, I should spend just as much time listening to where the conversation goes. 

07.	***How (Not) to Read the Bible*, Dan Kimball** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - Slighty academic, but maybe at a high-school level. Enjoyed digging into some of the controversies of the Bible. The subtitle says it all: "Making Sense of the Anti-women, Anti-science, Pro-violence, Pro-slavery and Other Crazy-Sounding Parts of Scripture."

08.	***You Are Not Your Own*, Alan Noble** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - This was my favorite book I read in 2022. Modern society has created a kind of zoochosis for us as humans: You have to be your own person and be completely yourself, work every day to discover and express yourself and use techniques and methods perfected by society to improve your life and conquer your obstacles. Or, maybe we don't belong to ourselves?

09.	***The Power of Regret*, Daniel Pink** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - This was an audiobook that I listened to a lot while training for my hike. I wish I would have had the physical book. Felt a bit self-helpy, but my biggest takeaway was "Feeling is for thinking. Thinking is for doing." Regret should be used to form behavior instead of letting it become your character"  And then a bonus thought, "If you are overthinking, write; if you are underthinking, read."

10.	***Build*, Tony Fadell** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - Huge anticipation for this, it was a little bit of a letdown, but I liked getting in Fadell's mind. Bunch of great quotes and thoughts for work as we build... The first three releases for your product: "You make the product. You fix the product. You build the business" and "To be a great designer, you have to notice problems."

11.	***Deep Work*, Cal Newport** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - Always good to read books that others reference in their books. Deep Work was a DEEP reminder that our modern workplace isn't always condusive to work. Made me take another look at what I'm doing and when.

12.	***The Laws of Simplicity*, John Madea** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - I've reread this book several times. It's a classic design book for me now. This is my go-to whenever a designer or developer asks for a book recommendation. Meant a LOT to me early in my career. The last page is üëå

13.	***The Life We're Looking For*, Andy Crouch** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - We're all chasing "magic" in our lives with technology. Maybe that's not great for personhood and genuine community. I'm still pretty excited about ChatGPT and Dall-e, though, but I'm pretty sure it will ruin many creative fields. 

14.	***The Deeply Formed Life*, Rich Villas** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - ‚ÄúWhether we know it or not, see it or not, or understand it or not, we are always at risk of being shallowly formed. We are formed by our false selves, our families of origin, the highly manipulated presentations of social media, and the value system of a world that determines worth based on accomplishments, possessions, efficiency, intellectual acumen, and gifts.‚Äù

15.	***Why We Sleep*, Matthew Walker** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - This, of course, made me value sleep MUCH more. I took a lack of sleep as a badge of honor in my twenties. Now I'm never apologizing for a nap again (clear head and recharged energy) and planning to live a long, healthy life. Here's to 7 to 8 hours a night!

16.	***The Power of Moments*, Chip Heath & Dan Heath**

     ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - This was a good "beach read." Nothing too Earth-shattering. There are a bunch of tactics you should occasionally use to make moments stick out to people in your life. The "multiply milestones" levels were interesting enough to write them out in a note.

17.	***Family Discipleship*, Matt Chandler** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - A good mix of practical and thoughtful opportunities. Super high AND low pressure, all at the same time. Feels like something I'll reference as our family grows up. Some great quotes from other people I found here: ‚ÄúThe moment when I am most repelled by a child's behavior, that is my sign to draw the very closest to that child‚Äù -Ann Voskamp and "It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.‚Äù -Frederick Douglass

18.	***The Psychology of Money*, Morgan Housel** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é -  I've never read a financial book outside of Dave Ramsey; lots of simple lessons, nothing too complicated. You will win some; you will lose some. Losing is the cost of winning. "The purpose of margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary" Outlier events play an enormous role in historical data. 

19.	***I Guess I Haven‚Äôt Learned that Yet*, Shauna Niequist** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - My wife read this and then assigned it to me. It was a nice change of pace to read a memoir, it made me want to move to New York City. I appreciated Shauna's perspective, wit and honesty!

20.	***No Compromise*, Melody Green** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - Super inspiring bio on an early CCM artist. Definitely, a man of the 70's who was always moving fast, tripping over himself, and tripping on some LSD. Loved getting a look into his earnest, journaled thoughts. It helped me be a little more truthful with my journaling.

21. ***A Non-Anxious Presence*, Mark Sayers** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - This was a super helpful book on how our personal lives, communities, workplaces, country, and world are changing. Complicated environments require efficiency. The incoming complex environment will require adaptability. ‚ÄúFake realities will create fake humans, which will lead to a disastrous cascade of crises in which fake humans will generate fake reality and then sell them to other humans, turning them, eventually, into forgeries of themselves." 

22.	***Micro*, Michael Crichton** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - My wife grabbed me two fiction books before we went away for the weekend to a family cabin. This was one of them. I've loved almost every Michael Crichton book I read. Really couldn't get into the "Honey, We Shrunk this Kids" techno-thriller.

23.	***The 5th Wave*, Rick Yancey** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - This was the second fiction book for my weekend away. It was turned into a movie. I enjoyed the alien invasion concept, but that's about it. Young Adult fiction is fine; I'll reread the Hunger Games next time.

24. ***Spiritual Leadership*, Oswald Sanders** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - The book title felt a little presumptuous, but I was glad to read something by an old dead guy! Written in the ‚Äô60s but revised a couple of times. I appreciate the cover design, especially over the 60‚Äôs version. The chapter on "Can you become a Leader" was intense!

25. ***Onward*, Howard Schultz** 
    
    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - I picked this up at our local thrift store on a whim and enjoyed it. I like Starbucks coffee, AND I like local hipster brands too. Loved getting an inside look at the difficult decisions Schultz had to make when we came back as CEO to turn around the company during the Great Recession.

26.	***Free-Range Kids*, Lenore Skenazy** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - TBH, this felt like it was written to uptight moms. I felt it allowed my kids to explore and do a bit more self-guided learning. I've alternatively been calling this "Cage Free Kids", a MUCH better title.

27. ***Spiritual Discipleship*, Oswald Sanders** 
    
    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é - Not as good as Spiritual Discipleship, but I worked through it pretty quickly. Planning to reread the whole trilogy once I finish Spiritual Maturity.     

28.	***Designing Your Life*, Bill Burnett & Dave Evans** 
    
    ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏é - I took my time working through this, but in the end, I didn't enjoy it. I was going to use this as a book club option at work, but it was about exploring career and life path changes. I prototyped some different ideas for my life, but in the end, I'm pretty happy with the one I'm on!

29.	***Levitation Wakes*, James S. A. Corey** 

    ‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é‚≠êÔ∏é -  It was great to restart the series. I intended to reread the whole series this year and then read the ninth and final book. But that never happened. I was gifted a Kindle at Christmas, so I impulsively decided to break it in with a fiction read!
