09.	***The Power of Regret*, Daniel Pink** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - This was an audio book that I listened to a lot while training for my hike. I really wish I would have had the physical book. Felt a bit self-helpy, but my biggest takeaway was "Feeling is for thinking. Thinking is for doing." Regret should be used to form behavior instead of letting it become your character"  And then a bonus thought "If you are overthinking write, if you are underthinking read"

10.	***Build*, Tony Fadell** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - Huge anticipation for this, was a little bit of a letdown, but really liked getting in Fadell's mind. Bunch of great quotes. The first three releases for your product: "You make the product. You fix the product. You build the business" and "To be a great designer, you have to notice problems"

11.	***Deep Work*, Cal Newport** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - Always good to read books that others reference in their books. Deep Work was a DEEP reminder that our modern workplace isn't always condusive to work. Definitely made me take another look at what I'm doing and when.

12.	***The Laws of Simplicity*, John Madea** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - I've reread this book a number of times. It's a classic design book for me now. Whenever a designer or developer asks for a book reccomendation, this is my go to. Meant a LOT to me early in my career. The last page is 👌

13.	***The Life We're Looking For*, Andy Crouch** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - We're all chasing "magic" in our lives with technology. Maybe that's not great for personhood and true community. I'm still pretty excited about ChatGPT and Dall-e though, but I'm pretty sure it's gonna ruin a bunch of creative fields. 

14.	***The Deeply Formed Life*, Rich Villas** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - “Whether we know it or not, see it or not, or understand it or not, we are always at risk of being shallowly formed. We are formed by our false selves, our families of origin, the highly manipulated presentations of social media, and the value system of a world that determines worth based on accomplishments, possessions, efficiency, intellectual acumen, and gifts.”

15.	***Why We Sleep*, Matthew Walker** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - This, of course, made me value sleep MUCH more. In my twenties, I took a lack of sleep as a badge of honor. Now I'm never apologizing for a nap again (clear head and recharged engery) and planning to live a long, healthy life. Here's to 7 to 8 hours a night!

16.	***The Power of Moments*, Chip Heath & Dan Heath** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - This was a good "beach read". Nothing too Earth shattering. There are a bunch of tatics you should use occasionally to make moments stick out to people in your life. The "multiply milestones" levels were interesting enought that I wrote them out in a Note.

17.	***Family Discipleship*, Matt Chandler** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - A good mix of practical and thoughtful opportunities. Super high AND low pressure, all at the same time. Feels like something I'll reference as our family grows up. Some great quotes from other people I found in here: “The moment when I am most repelled by a child's behavior, that is my sign to draw the very closest to that child” -Ann Voskamp and "It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.” -Frederick Douglass

18.	***The Psychology of Money*, Morgan Housel** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - I've never read a financial book outside of Dave Ramsey, lots of simple lessons, nothing too complicated. You will win some, you will lose some. Losing is the cost on winning. "The purpose of margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary" Outlier events play an enormous role in historical data. 

19.	***I Guess I Haven’t Learned that Yet*, Shauna Niequist** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - My wife read this and then assigned it to me. It was nice change of pace to read a memoir, made me want to move to New York City.

20.	***No Compromise*, Melody Green** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - Super inspiring bio on an early CCM artist. Definitely a man of the 70's who was always moving fast, tripping over himself, and tripping on some LSD. Loved getting a look into his earnest, journaled thoughts. I think it helped me be a little more truthful with my own journaling.

21. ***A Non-Anxious Presence*, Mark Sayers** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - This was a super helpful book on how our personal lives, communities, workplaces, country, and world is changing. Complicated environments required efficiency. The incoming complex environment will require adaptability. “Fake realities will create fake humans, which will lead to a disastrous cascade of crises in which fake humans will generate fake reality and then sell them to other humans, turning them, eventually, into forgeries of themselves." 

22.	***Micro*, Michael Crichton** ⭐︎⭐︎ - My wife grabbed me two fiction books before we went away for the weekend to a family cabin. This was one of them. I've loved almost every Michael Crichton book I read. Really couldn't get into the "Honey, We Shrunk this Kids" techno thriller.

23.	***The 5th Wave*, Rick Yancey** ⭐︎⭐︎ - This was the second fiction book for my weekend away. It was turned into a movie. I enjoyed the concept of the alien invasion, but that's about it. Young Adult fiction is fine, I'll reread the Hunger Games next time.

24. ***Spiritual Leadership*, Oswald Sanders** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - The book title felt a little presumptuous, but I was glad to read something by an old dead guy! Written in the 60’s but revised a couple times. I appreciate the cover design, especially over the 60’s version. The chapter on "Can you become a Leader" was intense!

25. ***Onward*, Howard Schultz** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - I picked this up at our local thrift store on a whim and really enjoyed it. I like Starbucks coffee AND I like local hipster brands too. Loved getting an inside look at the difficult decisions Schultz had to make when we came back as CEO to turn around the company during the Great Recession.

26.	***Free-Range Kids*, Lenore Skenazy** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - TBH, this felt like it was written to uptight mom's. I definitely felt like I have permission to let my kids explore and do a bit more self-guided learning. I've alernatively been calling this "Cage Free Kids", a MUCH better title.

27. ***Spiritual Discipleship*, Oswald Sanders** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ - Not as good as Spiritual Discipleship, but worked through it pretty quickly. Planning to the read the whole trilogy again once I finished Spirtual Maturity.   

28.	***Designing Your Life*, Bill Burnett & Dave Evans** ⭐️⭐︎ - I really took my time working through this, but in the end didn't enjoy it. I was gonna use this as a book club option at work, but it was really about exploring career and life path changes I prototyped some different ideas for my life, but in the end I'm pretty happy with the one I'm on.

29.	***Levitation Wakes*, James S. A. Corey** ⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎⭐︎ -  It was great to restart the series, I actually intended to reread the whole series this year so I could read the ninth book. So, squeezee one in!
